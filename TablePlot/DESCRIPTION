Description: A tableplot is a visualisation of a (large) statistical dataset with a dozen of variables, both both numeric and categorical. Each column represents a variable and each row bin is an aggregate of a certain number of records. The values of cells are depicted as horizontal bars. Missing values are taken into account. A GUI has been implemented which is used to easily customize the tableplot. Also supports large ffdf datasets from the ff package.
